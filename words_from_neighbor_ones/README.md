# Task
* Use the dictionary   unixdict.txt

* Ignore any word in the dictionary whose length is less than 9.


Let's take the words from next characters:
1 <= n < (dictionary length) - 9.
char1 = 1st character of         nth   word.
char2 = 2nd character of  (n+1)th  word.
char3 = 3rd character of  (n+2)th  word.
    â‹®
char9 = 9th character of  (n+8)th  word.


Concatenate (append) the nine characters by:

      newword = char1 + char2 + char3 + ... + char9 

If   newword   is in the dictionary, then show on this page.

Length of  newword = 9
