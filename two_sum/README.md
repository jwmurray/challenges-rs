## Task

Given a sorted array of integers (with possibly duplicates), is it possible to find a pair of integers from that array that sum up to a given sum? If so, return indices of the two integers or an empty array if not. The solution is not necessarily unique.


## Example

Given numbers = [0, 2, 11, 19, 90], sum = 21,
Because numbers[1] + numbers[3] = 2 + 19 = 21,
return [1, 3].
